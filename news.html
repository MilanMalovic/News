          		We all do silly things when we’ve had a little too much to drink. I remember getting absolutely plastered at my niece’s christening and saying things to family members which I would never dream of if not under the influence. So in some ways, I sympathise with drunk dognapper Toni Robinson.

				After a night out on the town, a hungover Toni woke up to someone else’s pooch on her bed. While the alarm bells would normally immediately ring, this was the third time for her.
