              <p>Swiss third seed Federer, chasing his 100th career title, seemed to be back to his best in Saturday's semi-final and looked stronger as the match wore on.</p>

              <p>The 37-year-old spurned set point in the first set tie-break and could only watch as Djokovic took the early advantage, roaring with emotion following a one hour 14 minute epic.</p>

              <p>But, with nothing separating the two in the second, Federer finally broke Djokovic to win the set and restore parity - the first service break of the match.</p>

              <p>Federer hit several sublime backhand shots down the line in the deciding set but Djokovic's serve was dominant, although the Serb grew frustrated as the set wore on, his opponent standing resolute.</p>

              <p>The third set tie-break proved Federer's undoing as he found himself unable to answer Djokovic, allowing the Serb to seal victory in three hours and two minutes.</p>

              <p>"<b>Novak is obviously on a roll. You can feel it. At the end it came down to a few things here and there," said Federer.</b></p>

              <p><b>"But overall I'm happy with my game. It's better than last week in Basel. There I won the tournament and here I played in the semis and it needed somebody of Novak's calibre to beat me."</b></p>

              <p><b>Djokovic will face Khachanov for only the second time in Sunday's final after the 22-year-old beat Thiem 6-4 6-1.</b></p>

              <p><b>"He's been playing some sensational tennis. He's striking the ball beautifully," Djokovic said.</b></p>

              <p><b>"I've got to use my experience and hopefully I can recover before then."</b></p>
